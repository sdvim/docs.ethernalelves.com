# Crusades

**Sentinels**\
****\
****With the sacrifice of $REN Sentinels will go on a long journey to acquire Artifacts.  Artifacts is a key component to releasing an Elder. Sentinels will need one Scroll to go on one Crusade.  Scrolls are not tradable and the amount received is determined by a stealth snapshot. \


**Artifacts** \
****\
****Artifacts will be a tradable (ERC721) non-fungible token. In theory, even if you are not going on Crusades, you can purchase Artifacts on the secondary to mint an Elder.  During the initial supply of Elders, you will still need a Sentinel when you go to the summoning ground.  Sentinels will require 7 Artifacts to mint 1 Elder.&#x20;

****

{% hint style="info" %}
In an earlier version of this page we had listed five kinds of Artifacts. That is no longer the case, there is just one type of Artifacts.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Crusades**

The length of Crusades will depend on your level.  The amount of Artifacts received is fair for all Sentinels.  You will receive an Artifact **after** you completed the Crusade.

You can use $MOON to enhance Crusades by:

* Use 5 $MOON to reduce the cost of going on Crusades by 300 $REN per Crusade, when going on a Crusade
* Use 15 $MOON to increase two (2) Artifacts' probability by 10% when returning from a Crusade.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: You can do one $MOON enhancement at a time. You cannot reduce the REN cost and increase Artifact probability in the same transaction

| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----- |

| Level 70-98  | 7    |
| Level 99-100 | 5    |

**Elders Mint**\


There will be an initial mint date to mint Elders.  Even if you acquired enough Artifacts to mint an Elder, you will have to wait until the initial mint date.\
\
Initial Mint Date - Late April/Early May\
\
Elders Crusades will open up shortly after to acquire Artifacts and mint the remaining Elders.\
\
Mint Price: 7 Artifacts
