# Crusades

**Sentinels**\
****\
****With the sacrifice of $REN Sentinels will go on a long journey to acquire Artifacts.  Artifacts is a key component to releasing an Elder. Sentinels will need one Scroll to go on one Crusade.  Scrolls are not tradable and the amount received is determined by a stealth snapshot. \


**Artifacts** \
****\
****There will be 5 types of Artifacts

* Vines
* Relics
* Magma
* Rime
* Groves

Artifact type names may be subject to change

The type will have no effect when minting Elders, however, it will play a factor in what type of Armor you can upgrade to in the future as well as unlocking special abilities.\
\
Artifacts will be a tradable (ERC721) non-fungible token. In theory, even if you are not going on Crusades, you can purchase Artifacts on the secondary to mint an Elder.  During the initial supply of Elders, you will still need a Sentinel when you go to the summoning ground.  Sentinels will require 7 Artifacts to mint 1 Elder.&#x20;

**Crusades**

The length of Crusades will depend on your level.  The amount of Artifacts received is fair for all Sentinels.  You will receive an Artifact **after** you completed the Crusade.\


| Area              | 1 Artifact | 2 Artifacts | $REN  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Tartarean Crusade | 90%        | 10%         | 1,500 |

| Level        | Days |
| ------------ | ---- |
| Level 1-69   | 9    |
| Level 70-98  | 7    |
| Level 99-100 | 5    |

**Elders Mint**\


There will be an initial mint date to mint Elders.  Even if you acquired enough Artifacts to mint an Elder, you will have to wait until the initial mint date.\
\
Initial Mint Date - Late April/Early May\
\
Elders Crusades will open up shortly after to acquire Artifacts and mint the remaining Elders.
