# Genesis Orcs

The EtherOrcs of Valkala have long been a mysterious and elusive race, rarely seen by outsiders. The Orcs are fiercely loyal to their homeland and have long been in search of allies to help them in their struggles.

The EtherOrcs were created by the Elven god, Eir, and given a solemn task - to guard the sacred land of Valkala. For centuries, they watched over the land, protecting it from any and all danger.

Recently, Valkala has come under threat from a powerful and ancient force. The Ether Orcs have been unable to fend off this enemy alone, and have sought aid from the Ethernal Elves. The Elves have agreed to help the Orcs, and in return, the Orcs have pledged their loyalty and service to the Elves.

The EtherOrcs are now working alongside the Elves, protecting the sacred land of Valkala from any and all threats. They are a proud and noble race and are determined to do whatever it takes to protect their home and the people within it.
