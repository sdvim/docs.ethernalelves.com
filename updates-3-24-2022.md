# Updates

### **Overview**

What are Artifacts and how important are they in the Ethernal Elves ecosystem? Artifacts are the spirit of the Elves which strengthens the Elven universe. With a combination of Blood and Spirit, their world can rebuild to be stronger than before. Simply put, Miren is equivalent to oil and an Artifact is equivalent to the reagent that helps produce the end product of what oil creates. Where Elders are the Creators in the Elvenverse.  Once Sentinels go on their initial Crusades, they will no longer be able to obtain Artifacts. \
\
Artifacts will be able to mint the following:\
\
Mint Elders\
Upgrade Elders\*\
Mint Land\
\
...and unlock more in-game assets to come

{% hint style="info" %}
\*upgrades may include armor and special abilities
{% endhint %}

### **Crusades**

\
Sentinels will receive **scrolls** based on their Elder eligibility, sacrifice $REN and embark on the boat to go on a long journey in search for Artifacts for 5-7 days.   The number of scrolls received is the number of times you can go on Crusades. You only will be able to go on 1 Crusade per TX.  You will be able to reduce Crusade times by one or two days based on the level probability table.  Elders will have a similar path to Artifacts but it will be more active and robust. \
\
1 Scroll = 1 Crusade (For Sentinels Only)\
7 Artifacts = 1 Elder (Initial Mint)

### **Artifacts**

There will be 5 types of Artifacts

* Vines
* Relics
* Magma
* Rime
* Groves

{% hint style="info" %}
Artifact type names may be subject to change
{% endhint %}

The type will have no effect when minting Elders, however, it will play a factor in what type of Armor you can upgrade to in the future as well as unlocking special abilities.\
\
Artifacts will be a tradable (ERC721) non-fungible token. In theory, even if you are not going on Crusades, you can purchase Artifacts on the secondary to mint an Elder.  During the initial supply of Elders, you will still need a Sentinel when you go to the summoning ground.  Sentinels will require 7 Artifacts to mint 1 Elder.&#x20;

### **Snapshot**

As stated in our whitepaper upon launch, we wanted to find a fair method to distribute the Elders to our Sentinel holders so that holders with just one Sentinel would have a fair chance of acquiring an Elder. We were able to accomplish this by determining the following:

1\) Wallet Holder Date – The date which we take a snapshot to see when you were a holder

2\) Elder Count Date – The date which we take a snapshot of how many Elders you are eligible for

3\) Groups - We divided the holders into Groups\
\
Note: To help to prevent wallet transfers around snapshot dates, the number of Sentinels you held on the Wallet Holder Date did not matter; however, you needed to remain a holder through the Elder Count Date snapshot, which is the date that counted your Sentinel eligibility.

Group 1

* Wallet Holder Date - February 4, 2022 to February 14, 2022
* Elder Count Date - February 14, 2022
* \~1,600 Eligible Elders
* Wallets that were not included on the February 4 date but are a new entry on the February 14 snap shot are included in Group 2

Examples:

a) If you had 4 Sentinels on February 4 and had 10 on February 14, you would be eligible for 3 Elders versus 2.

b) If you had 20 Sentinels on February 4 and had 2 on February 14, you would only be eligible for 1 Elder versus 4.

You will receive a specific number of Scrolls to go on Crusades depending on how many Elders you are eligible for. Since you need 7 Artifacts to mint an Elder, if you are eligible for 2 Elders, you will get at least 14 Scrolls. Lastly, there will be a 3rd and final snapshot for new holders.
