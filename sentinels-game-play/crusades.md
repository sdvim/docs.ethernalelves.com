# Crusades

### **Sentinels**

With the sacrifice of $REN, Sentinels will go on a long journey to acquire Artifacts. Artifacts are a key component to releasing an Elder. Sentinels will need one Scroll to go on one Crusade.  Scrolls are not tradable and the amount received is determined by a stealth snapshot. If you have a Sentinel returning from a Crusade, you can send that Sentinel back out on a Crusade as long as you have Scrolls in your Elven Wallet. &#x20;

**Purchase Scrolls**\
****Additional Scrolls will be available to purchase from May 9th 2022.  See the table below.&#x20;

| Scroll Supply    | $REN  |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Tranche 1: 2,000 | 750   |
| Tranche 2: 2,000 | 1,500 |

### **Artifacts**&#x20;

Once you complete a Crusade, you need to "Return from Crusade" to receive your reward. The reward will be "in-game" balance. You can mint your Artifact from the Elven Wallet on May 9th.&#x20;

The length of Crusades will depend on your level.  The amount of Artifacts received is fair for all Sentinels.  You will receive an Artifact **after** you completed the Crusade.

### **$MOON Utility**

You can use $MOON to enhance Crusades by:

* Use 5 $MOON to reduce the cost of going on Crusades by 300 $REN per Crusade, when going on a Crusade
* Use 15 $MOON to increase two (2) Artifacts' probability by 10% when returning from a Crusade.

**How to use $MOON for Crusades**

When you go on Crusades, you will see two sections, with the headline Select Elves to send on Crusades&#x20;

You will notice a checkbox in each section above which you can then reduce the amount of $REN in section 1 or increase Artifacts probability in section 2.  Simply select the checkbox prior to clicking on **Send Crusade** or **Return from Crusades** if you want to use $MOON.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: You can do one $MOON enhancement at a time. You cannot reduce the REN cost more than once or increase the probability more than once per Crusade. You will be able to send multiple Elves and use $MOON in one TX.
