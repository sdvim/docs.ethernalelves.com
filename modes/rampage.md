Burn $REN to gain levels, weapons, and _accessories_. Druids may also have morphing abilities. There will be a base pool for leveling and pools per Sentinel class.\
\
More information is coming soon but the three variables below will be important:

* **$REN:** players will need $REN to gain levels and enter into specific pools&#x20;
* **Levels:** Sentinels who are above level 60+ have a decent head start over those below level 60
* **Race:** Woodborne may have higher chances at finding higher tier accessories

#### Accessories

Accessories will play an important role in future game modes we develop.

It will also strengthen your character in [Bloodthirst](bloodthirst.md).
