This game mode is where you gain levels. You will also have a chance to upgrade your Sentinel with a chance to acquire accessories, weapons, 1/1s and morphing abilities for Druids.

There will be a base pool for leveling and pools per Sentinel Class\
\
More information coming soon but the three variables below will be important

* $REN&#x20;
  * Accumulating $REN will be important as you will need $REN to gain levels and enter into specific pools&#x20;
* Levels&#x20;
  * Levels will be important and those who are level 60+ have a decent head start over people below level 60
* Race&#x20;
  * Having a Woodborne may give you a higher chance

Accessories will play an important role in future game modes we develop.  It will also strengthen your character in Bloodthirst.&#x20;

More info coming soon
