# Boss Battles

Boss Battles is an active game mode where you can use your training and acquired gear to fight various creatures who threaten the elves way of life.

The game continues until either the player or the creature die. The game will also end if the player runs out of energy.

#### **Actions**

You have two active actions and two passive actions.

#### _**Active**_

1. Primary Attack: Use your **primary weapon**. The attack delivered is the sum of the players base attack plus the primary weapon attack points. Primary weapons also have passive abilities
2. Secondary Attack: Secondary Attack: Use your **secondary weapon**. The attack delivered is the sum of the players base attack plus the primary weapon attack points.

There are two mechanics that determine your hit chance and your attack efficiency

1. The probability of a hit chance increases with **intelligence** relative to max stat for the class
2. Attack efficiency increases with **strength** relative to max stat for the class

#### _**Passive Actions**_

1. Dodge: The probability of dodging an attack increases with agility relative to max stat for the class. If you rolled a dodge, the creature will completely miss the attack.
2. Passive Ability: The probability of using your passive ability is determined by the weapon currently equipped.
