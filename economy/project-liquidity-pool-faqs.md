# Project Liquidity Pool FAQ's

## **Why a project owned Liquidity Pool?**

Protocol Owned Liquidity is a great way for projects to ensure the long-term success of their native assets.

When a project manages a Liquidity Pool, the project team can take certain actions to help keep the pool healthy. In the Ethernal Elves Project LP, we will lock up liquidity permanently. In return, the project will provide liquidity providers incentives.

When you provide liquidity to the project pool, you will receive[ SLP tokens (SushiSwap Liquidity Provider tokens)](https://docs.sushi.com/products/amm-exchange/liquidity-pools) which can be exchanged for $MOON.&#x20;

### LP Incentives&#x20;

#### **Receive $MOON in exchange for SLP** &#x20;

You can swap $SLP from the Project LP for $MOON using the Elven Wallet. The MOON per SLP will adjust based on the supply remaining, as per the bonding curve in the table below.&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th>$MOON LP  Tier Supply</th><th align="center">$MOON LP Suply Remaining</th><th data-type="number">$MOON PER $SLP at Tier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1: 300,000</td><td align="center"> 1,400,000</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 2: 300,000</td><td align="center"> 1,100,000</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3: 300,000</td><td align="center"> 800,000</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4: 300,000</td><td align="center"> 500,000</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5: 50,000</td><td align="center"> 200,000</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 6: 50,000</td><td align="center">150,000</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 7: 50,000</td><td align="center">100,000</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 8: 50,000</td><td align="center">50,000</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table>

**What is $MOON and its utility?**

$MOON has the following utility

1. In-game use
2. Governance: Vote on future proposals
3. Receive a percentage of $REN burn through staking (details to follow)

Current In game use:

* Use 5 $MOON to reduce the cost of going on Crusades by 300 $REN per Crusade
* Use 15 $MOON to increase two (2) Artifacts probability by 10%

#### $MOON Supply:&#x20;

There will be a fixed supply of $MOON. When $MOON is used in-game, it will go back into Treasury, effectively removing it from circulation.

****LP Rewards: 1,400,000\
Treasury: 600,000\
Elders: 2,000,000

Total: 1,400,000

### **Why we are using Polygon?**

We are deploying the LP on Polygon for a few reasons, firstly, the game is expanding on Polygon so it would make sense to also have REN available on Polygon as pREN. Secondly, trading fees and gas on Polygon is much cheaper than on Eth, reducing our players costs. Finally, we are building an ecosystem of tokens managed through the Elven Wallet – it makes its simpler to manage.

### **Why should you provide liquidity?**

Providing permanent liquidity will help keep the pool healthy and create a sustainable game economy in the long term.

Currently, the only way to get $MOON is by providing liquidity and swapping your LP tokens (SLP) for $MOON

{% hint style="info" %}
You can still provide liquidity without swapping it for $MOON. Rewards will be limited to fees earned from Sushi Swap and you can withdraw your liquidity at any time.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## **How to bridge $REN from ETH to Polygon**

You can bridge REN that you have as a game credit or in your eth wallet, on Ethereum by first claiming REN to your wallet (if you have REN to claim) and then click **"SEND REN to GAME**". This will take 5 to 10 minutes to complete.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not attempt to bridge REN using the Polygon POS Bridge. Only use the dApp bridge as described above.
{% endhint %}

## **How do I provide liquidity?**

### **Step 1: Get pREN**

Make sure you have pREN in your wallet on Polygon. Go to the Elven Wallet, click approve (if doing this the first time) in the pREN token box. A web3 prompt will ask you to approve the contract to spend your pREN. This a one time approval will cost some gas and require you to be connected to Matic/Polygon.

![](../.gitbook/assets/1.png)

After the approval completes, you should see two buttons, “To Game” and “To Wallet”.

&#x20;Click on To Wallet to withdraw pREN from your in game balance to your web3 wallet. Wait for about 30 seconds and then click on “Refresh Balance”. Proceed to step 2.

### **Step 2: Deploy Liquidity**

&#x20;Visit [WETH/pREN LP on Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/trident/add?tokens=0x7ceB23fD6bC0adD59E62ac25578270cFf1b9f619\&tokens=0xA2eCFEBe618E90608882c4aD6b3a2eA6FdEB5e46\&fee=30\&twap=false\&chainId=137), input an equal value of ETH and $REN. This link will show something like the following image, where assets can be added to the LP:
