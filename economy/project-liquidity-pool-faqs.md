# Project Liquidity Pool FAQ's

## **Why a project owned Liquidity Pool?**

When a project manages a Liquidity Pool, the project team can take certain actions to help keep the pool healthy. In the Ethernal Elves Project LP, we will lock up liquidity permanently and provide incentives to liquidity providers for doing that.

When you provide liquidity to the project pool, you will receive[ SLP tokens (SushiSwap Liquidity Provider tokens)](https://docs.sushi.com/products/amm-exchange/liquidity-pools) which can be exchanged for $MOON

### LP Incentives&#x20;

#### **Receive $MOON in exchange for SLP** &#x20;

You can swap SLP's from the project LP for $MOON using the Elven Wallet. The MOON per SLP will be swaped as per the bonding in the table below.&#x20;

| MOON LP Supply | MOON PER SLP  |
| :------------: | :-----------: |
|    1,400,000   |       50      |
|   1,100,000    |       36      |
|    800,000     |       32      |
|    500,000     |      28       |
|    200,000     |       26      |
|    150,000     |       24      |
|    100,000     |       22      |
|     50,000     |       20      |

**What is $MOON and its utility?**

$MOON has the following utility

1. In-game use
2. Governance: Vote on future proposals
3. Receive a percentage of $REN burn through staking (details to follow)

In game use:

* Use 5 $MOON to reduce the cost of going on Crusades by 300 $REN per Crusade
* Use 15 $MOON to increase two (2) Artifacts probability by 10%

#### $MOON Supply:&#x20;

There will be a fixed supply of $MOON. When $MOON is used in-game, it will go back into Treasury, effectively removing it from circulation.

**Token Distribution**\
****LP Rewards: 1,400,000\
Treasury: 600,000\
Elders: 2,000,000

Total: 1,400,000

### **Why we are using Polygon?**

We are deploying the LP on Polygon for a few reasons, firstly, the game is expanding on Polygon so it would make sense to also have REN available on Polygon as pREN. Secondly, trading fees and gas on Polygon is much cheaper than on Eth, reducing our players costs. Finally, we are building an ecosystem of tokens managed through the Elven Wallet – it makes its simpler to manage.

### **Why should you provide liquidity?**

Providing permanent liquidity will help keep the pool healthy and create a sustainable game economy in the long term.

Currently, the only way to get $MOON is by providing liquidity and swapping your LP tokens (SLP) for $MOON

## **How do I provide liquidity?**

### **Step 1: Get pREN**

Make sure you have pREN in your wallet on Polygon. Go to the Elven Wallet, click approve (if doing this the first time) in the pREN token box. A web3 prompt will ask you to approve the contract to spend your pREN. This a one time approval will cost some gas and require you to be connected to Matic/Polygon.

After the approval completes, you should see two buttons, “To Game” and “To Wallet”.

&#x20;Click on To Wallet to withdraw pREN from your in game balance to your web3 wallet. Wait for about 30 seconds and then click on “Refresh Balance”. Proceed to step 2.

This link will show something like the following image, where assets can be added to the LP:
