# The Elven Wallet

All in-game tokens, balances, and assets can be found in the Elven Wallet. To use any Ethernal Elves tokens in-game, you have to first transfer them to the game. We have built a simple interface to help you do this.

You can access the Elven Wallet by clicking on the hamburger menu in the top left corner.&#x20;

![All current and future assets can be bridged to the game from the Elven Wallet](../.gitbook/assets/Wallet.png)

### Approve Contract

Before you can use the Elven Wallet to deposit or withdraw funds from your game balance, you need to approve the ElvenWallet contract to transact tokens on your behalf. You will have to do this for each token you want to use in the Elven Wallet.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will need to be connected to Polygon/MATIC for approvals. Approvals require a small amount of MATIC.
{% endhint %}

### Deposit To Game

When you click on the "To Game" button, the contract will move tokens from your web3 eth compabible wallet (like Metamask) to your in game balance.

{% hint style="success" %}
This is gasless! Once you have approved the contract, you do not need to pay for gas when you use the Elven Wallet again!
{% endhint %}

### Withdraw to Wallet

When you click on the "To Wallet" button, the contract will transfer tokens from your in-game balance in the Elven Wallet to your eth compabible wallet.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
This is a gasless transaction.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Add Token to Wallet

Clicking this button will add the token to your Metamask or web3 wallet.&#x20;
