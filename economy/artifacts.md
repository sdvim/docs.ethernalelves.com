Artifacts are fragments of extremely rare materials that have supernatural properties and can be used within the Ethernal Elves ecosystem to resurrect new gameplay elements, like the Elders. Artifacts are a ERC1155 semifungible token and can either be minted by earning them in-game, or bought from a secondary marketplace like Opensea.

Leading up to Chapter Two, artifacts can only be found by going into Crusades. Artifacts will always be useful in the EE ecosystem.
